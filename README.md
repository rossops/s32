# Sega System 32 / Multi 32 for MiSTer FPGA

An open FPGA recreation of Sega's System 32 and Multi 32 arcade hardware
(1990–1994) for the MiSTer DE10-Nano. The project is source-first and does
not distribute commercial arcade ROMs.

This is an active work in progress. A tick means the game is currently
working on the target MiSTer setup; an X means it is not yet ready.

## What the core implements

- System 32 video: four scrolling/zooming tilemap layers, text and bitmap
  layers, a hardware-style sprite list with zoom, priority, blending, fades,
  and 320/416-pixel display modes.
- Audio: Z80 sound CPU, two YM3438-compatible FM channels, RF5C68-family PCM,
  and the Multi 32 MultiPCM path.
- Board devices: 315-5296 I/O, 93C46 EEPROM save/load, MSM6253 gun ADC,
  µPD4701 trackball counters, 8255 PPI, timers/interrupt controller, and the
  V25 protection path used by Golden Axe 2 and Arabian Fight.
- MiSTer integration: MRA-based ROM loading, 16-bit HPS transfers, Cyclone V
  SDRAM for ROM regions, and the DE10-Nano DDR3 framebuffer for sprites.

## NEC V60/V70 CPU

`rtl/cpu/v60/s32_v60.sv` is a from-scratch, synthesizable NEC V60 core with a
parameterized V70 profile. System 32 uses the µPD70616 V60 at about 16.108 MHz
with a 16-bit external bus; Multi 32 uses the µPD70632 V70 profile at 20 MHz
with a 32-bit board bus (the current adapter keeps the proven 16-bit cycle
interface where required). Both are little-endian 32-bit CISC processors.

The implementation is a sequential micro-sequencer with a bounded prefetch
queue and a small instruction-stream cache. It models the programmer-visible
registers, banked interrupt stacks, PSW/system registers, traps and interrupts,
full integer/bit/string/decimal instruction groups, effective-address modes,
unaligned accesses, and V60↔Z80 synchronization. MMU paging and floating-point
groups are intentionally outside the System 32 arcade profile; unsupported FP
opcodes take the reserved-instruction path. Directed tests and differential
traces against MAME cover the implemented arcade instruction set.

## Core architecture and the V60 data path

The top level separates a `clk_sys` domain (CPU, bus, I/O, sound and most video)
from a 2× `clk_ram` domain (SDRAM and sprite datapath). The generated PLL runs
`clk_sys` at 48.317307 MHz, `clk_ram` at 96.634615 MHz, and the real V25 compute
domain at 24.158653 MHz; fractional clock enables derive the original board
rates. ROMs stream through the MiSTer HPS loader into
SDRAM. The V60 bus decoder arbitrates work RAM, VRAM, palette, I/O, protection,
sound and ROM accesses. Tilemaps and the sprite engine feed the priority mixer;
sprite pixels are rendered into DDR3-backed line buffers so SDRAM ROM traffic
cannot starve the display path.

The ROM loader supports legacy fixed index-0 streams and optimized region MRAs.
Current MRAs transfer only populated MAME regions on indexes 4–9, then send the
64-byte board descriptor on index 0 as the final boot commit. This avoids up to
16 MiB of padding per launch while keeping CPUs reset until loading is complete.

The SDRAM byte map is: main CPU `0x000000`, sound CPU `0x200000`, tiles
`0x600000`, PCM `0xA00000`, V25 program `0xE00000`, and sprites `0x1000000`.
The loader preserves little-endian 16-bit HPS transfers and descrambles V25
program addresses while writing them.

## Building from source

Quartus Prime Lite 17.0.2 Build 602 is the pinned toolchain. On Windows, point
`QUARTUS_ROOT` at the installation and run the audited build driver:

```bat
set QUARTUS_ROOT=D:\Q17
tools\build-s32.bat
tools\build-s32v25.bat
```

The repository ships two System 32 profiles and one Multi 32 revision:

- `s32.rbf` supports every generated System 32 MRA except Golden Axe and
  Arabian Fight. It compiles out the real V25 CPU, its ROM cache and dedicated
  memories while retaining the descriptor-driven ADC, trackball, PPI,
  protection-HLE, dual-PCB, gun, sprite, video and audio paths.
- `s32v25.rbf` supports Golden Axe and Arabian Fight. It includes the real V25
  execution core and selects the correct protection table and V60 cadence from
  each MRA descriptor. Unrelated peripherals and all Multi 32 logic are
  compiled out.
- `s32OutRunners.rbf` is the dedicated Multi 32 revision for OutRunners, built
  with `tools\build-outrunners.bat`. Its QSF is generated from the shared
  project with the single-screen macro stripped, which keeps the descriptor-led
  Multi 32 hardware in the image: the V70 clock rate, the second 315-5296 I/O
  chip, work RAM at 128 KiB, the screen A/B select, and MultiPCM audio. The
  OutRunners MRAs name this RBF and carry the driving-cabinet analog profile
  plus the split shift/DJ button layout in their board descriptor.

Both wrappers preserve Quartus compilation databases for Smart Recompile,
serialize builds through the repository lock, enforce the account-wide
six-worker Fast Fit policy, run multicorner timing, and stage hash-verified
RBFs under `releases/`.

The audited driver takes an exclusive repository build lock, rejects other
Quartus/Qsys compiler processes, validates the exact toolchain and host
resources, cleans stale databases, regenerates the PLL, fingerprints all map
inputs, retries only classified compiler crashes, and sweeps fitter seeds
starting with the best archived seed (2). It runs multicorner timing and stages
an RBF only when the map, fit, STA, assembler, input hashes, report freshness,
seed, non-negative slack, and RBF freshness all agree. The optional
`S32_FIT_SEEDS`, `S32_MAP_RETRIES`, and `S32_FIT_RETRIES` environment variables
are range-checked and printed by preflight. A merely generated RBF is not
considered deployable.

The old Linux/Docker compile entrypoints fail fast because they cannot reproduce
the qualified Quartus 17.0.2 Windows flow. Public CI performs source/profile
checks and simulation only; release RBFs are produced locally through
the matching dedicated build wrapper.

Useful checks that do not build an RBF are:

```sh
bash verif/run_regression.sh
python -m unittest discover -s verif -p "test_*.py"
```

## Requirements and installation

- MiSTer DE10-Nano with an SDRAM expansion (32 MB is sufficient for the
  supported System 32 profiles).
- A matching MAME ROM set. ROMs remain the user's responsibility and are not
  included here.

Copy `s32.rbf` and `s32v25.rbf` to `_Arcade/cores/` and the generated MRAs to
`_Arcade/`, then launch a title from the MiSTer arcade menu.

## Licence and credits

The behavioral reference is MAME's `segas32` driver. The V25 execution core is
vendored from the GPL s80x86 project; see that directory for its licence. Other
RTL is original or carries its upstream licence header. Arcade ROMs remain the
property of their respective owners.
